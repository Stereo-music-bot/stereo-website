## Important information

We expect you to have a basic understanding of JavaScript / TypeScript hosting of things like websites and Discord bots when using one of our repositories. Do **not** ask general questions like "How to install NodeJS?" or "How to update .env" in both our Discord server and the issue tracker.

Please don't open issues or ask for support with the reason "... doesn't work". If something does not work, **explain** as detailed as possible what went wrong, how to reproduce it and what versions you used (NodeJS version, etc)

Hosting your own version is allowed, however, there is **1 rule**. MIT License doesn't mean oh, I can just steal the bot and say it's mine. No, you leave credits where they are and you clearly state that the bot is created by **us**. That's easy you might think. Well not for the users who think, that credits are bullshit and don't want it. It's the only thing I want you guys to do, nothing more.

## Install

**Make sure you have the latest version of NodeJS installed (v16).**
_Note: the install guide uses yarn to explain what to do, don't forget that you don't need yarn to install packages, you can also use npm or pnpm_

To install all the dependencies, run the following command in your terminal: `yarn install`

After installing the dependencies, run: `yarn run build`. This will create a ".next" folder which will contain all the files needed to run the website.

The last step is to run `yarn start` this will start the web server and launch the website.

When you for some reason can only host static files, run `yarn export`, this will generate static html files. (This may disable a few functions, I am not 100% because I don't personally use it)

It's recommened to use `yarn run dev`, the developement server when you want to edit the website. You can restart your server everytime, but there is a reason why they created a developement server, it also saves you a lot of time.
